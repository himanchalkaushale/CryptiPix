## Project Overview & Concept

### 1. What is CryptiPix and what problem does it solve?
**Expected Answer:** CryptiPix is an image steganography tool that allows users to hide secret messages within images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique. It solves the problem of secure, covert communication by making messages invisible to the naked eye while maintaining image quality.
